Event Management System
Overview
The Event Management System is a command-line program built in C# that allows users to manage events. Users can create, update, delete, and view events through a simple text-based interface. This system also provides the option to go back to the main menu at any point during the process and provides error handling for invalid inputs.

Features
Create Events: Users can create new events by providing details like name, description, date, and location.
Update Events: Users can update event details (name, description, date, and location) by providing an event ID.
Delete Events: Users can delete events by specifying the event ID.
View Events: Users can list all events or view specific event details.
Back to Menu: At any time, users can type 'back' to return to the main menu or choose to exit the program.
Error Handling: The system handles invalid inputs, such as non-numeric event IDs or incorrect date formats, and provides guidance for valid input.
